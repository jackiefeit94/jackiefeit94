SpyQL is a browser-based game designed to teach new developers SQL. It has 3 levels. In level one, players query from a single table. In level two, players create their own table. And in level three, players join multiple tables, all in order to catch a cyber criminal. | Weather Watcher is a Google Chrome Extension that helps folks stay informed about climate change, by showing temperature increases graphically, and by providing top news on climate change. Users can see the weather where they are currently using the Find Me feature, or they can input their location or other locations manually.
